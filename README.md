The Movie App is simple: It lets you lookup movie info and bookmark them.
Why the bookmarking you ask? Well, I dont know, use it as a to-watch list or something, you figure it out.

## Some random thoughts

- This project was coded hastily in Java just before I switched to Kotlin, So Im planning to rewrite this with Kotlin, MVVM, Jetpack, and maybe even Room just because.
- The activity transitions are still a little glitchy. `//TODO` for later. Hoping Switching to the new Material motion will solve it

## Usage

Feel free to clone the project and build it yourself. Or if you're feeling lazy, grab the apk from [releases](https://github.com/shahimclt/starrynight/releases) and get going.
